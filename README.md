## 📘 Overview
This repository provides simplified, read-only Python scripts and figures that reproduce the key results and visualizations from the paper:

> **Salah-Eddin Gherbi (2025)**  
> *The Gravitational Quantization Law: A Universal Harmonic Framework for Planetary Orbits*  
> arXiv: [astro-ph.EP] (pending submission)  
> Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17432971](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17432971)

The research investigates the harmonic and geometric structure of the Solar System using algebraic ratios derived from the Silver Ratio (√2 + 1).  
It proposes a unifying **gravitational quantization law** that models planetary spacing through geometric resonance — achieving sub-1 % mean error when compared to observed orbital data.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### `/scripts/`
Minimal Python scripts for reproducing the core analyses and plots:
- `planetary_harmonic_ratios_chart.py` — Compares observed and modeled orbital distances.  
- `harmonic_ladder_visualization.py` — Visualizes RMSE and harmonic stability index (HSI) vs. Harmonia’s position.  
- `planetary_harmonic_percent_deviation_with_inset.py` — Plots percentage deviations with a zoom on the harmonic node.  
- `planetary_distances_observed_vs_celtic_log.py` — Compares observed vs. predicted distances in logarithmic scale.

Each script runs independently and generates publication-ready figures (PDF/PNG).

### `/figures/`
Rendered figures corresponding to each script.  
These are direct outputs of the models and suitable for citation or inclusion in publications.

### `/proofs/` *(optional, not public in all releases)*
Contains `.asc`, `.ots`, and `_proof.txt` files documenting authorship, SHA-256 checksums, and blockchain timestamps for verification integrity.

## 🧮 Computational Environment
All code was written in **Python 3**, using standard scientific libraries:
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scipy`

All numerical results were computed in double precision.  
Plots use consistent color palettes (gold–indigo) for visual clarity.

---

## 🔒 Authorship and Integrity

All research scripts and results are **cryptographically timestamped** and **digitally signed** to ensure authorship integrity and reproducibility.  
A private `/proof/` archive (excluded from this repository) contains verified OpenTimestamps (`.ots`) proofs, GPG signatures (`.asc`), and manifest files (`_proof.txt`) for each script.  
These materials are securely stored offline and available for independent verification upon formal request.

The **full research implementation**, including advanced optimization and analysis scripts, will be released following the publication of the author’s forthcoming book.  
**Meanwhile, qualified researchers may request access to these extended materials for verification or collaborative purposes.**

**Access Policy:**  
Access to the private repository containing full source files and verification materials may be granted to verified researchers or collaborators upon formal request. Contact the author at [salahealer@gmail.com](mailto:salahealer@gmail.com) for details.

## 🧪 How to Reproduce the Figures

1. **Clone or download** this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salahealer9/harmonic-architecture-solar-system.git
   cd harmonic-architecture-solar-system/scripts

2. **Install required packages** (Python 3.10+):
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

3. **Run the scripts** to regenerate all figures:
   python harmonic_ladder_visualization.py
   python planetary_harmonic_ratios_chart.py
   python planetary_harmonic_percent_deviation_with_inset.py
   python planetary_distances_observed_vs_celtic_log.py

   Each script will automatically produce .pdf and .png outputs in the working directory.

## 🧭 Verification Notes
For details on digital signatures and cryptographic timestamps, see the *Authorship and Integrity* section above.  
All original research files were timestamped and signed for integrity using:

- **.asc** → GPG digital signature  
- **.ots** → OpenTimestamps blockchain proof  
- **_proof.txt** → SHA-256 manifest  

Verification materials are stored in the private `/proof/` archive and are available for independent validation upon request.
