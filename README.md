## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the core analytical and visualization scripts accompanying the paper:

> **Salah-Eddin Gherbi (2025)**  
> *The Gravitational Quantization Law: A Universal Harmonic Framework for Planetary Orbits*  
> arXiv: [astro-ph.EP] (pending submission)  
> Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.17432971](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17432971)

The research reinterprets Kepler's celestial harmony using the Celtic Cross harmonic model — a geometric framework based on algebraic ratios of √2 and its derivatives. The model accurately predicts planetary spacing, identifies the lost planet Harmonia at ≈ 2.14 AU, and demonstrates that the Solar System obeys a quantized harmonic order.

All included Python scripts reproduce the published figures, tables, and numerical results of the paper.

### `/figures/`
Rendered figures corresponding to each script.  
These are direct outputs of the models and are suitable for citation or publication.

### `/proofs/` *(not public in all releases)*
Contains `.asc`, `.ots`, and `_proof.txt` files documenting authorship, SHA-256 checksums, and blockchain timestamps for verification integrity.

## 🔹 5. Access to Extended Materials

Additional analytical and verification scripts (full suite of 26) are retained in a private research repository.

Researchers interested in the complete dataset, verification proofs, or replication materials may request access directly from the author at [salahealer@gmail.com](mailto:salahealer@gmail.com).

---

## 🧮 Computational Environment
All code was written in **Python 3**, using standard scientific libraries:
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scipy`

All numerical results were computed in double precision.  
Plots use consistent color palettes (gold–indigo) for visual clarity.

---

## 🔒 Authorship and Integrity

All research scripts and results are **cryptographically timestamped** and **digitally signed** to ensure authorship integrity and reproducibility.  
A private `/proof/` archive (excluded from this repository) contains verified OpenTimestamps (`.ots`) proofs, GPG signatures (`.asc`), and manifest files (`_proof.txt`) for each script.  
These materials are securely stored offline and available for independent verification upon formal request.

The **full research implementation**, including advanced optimization and analysis scripts, will be released following the publication of the author’s forthcoming book.  
**Meanwhile, qualified researchers may request access to these extended materials for verification or collaborative purposes.**

**Access Policy:**  
Access to the private repository containing full source files and verification materials may be granted to verified researchers or collaborators upon formal request. Contact the author at [salahealer@gmail.com](mailto:salahealer@gmail.com) for details.

## 🧪 How to Reproduce the Figures

1. **Clone or download** this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salahealer9/harmonic-architecture-solar-system.git
   cd harmonic-architecture-solar-system/scripts
   ```
2. **Install required packages** (Python 3.10+):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
   ```
4. **Run the scripts** to regenerate all figures:
   ```bash
   python celtic_kepler_symbolic_verification.py
   python celtic_full_system_verification.py
   python celtic_full_system_rmse.py
   python harmonia_position_optimization.py
   python harmonic_dual_optimization.py
   python harmonic_basin_compact.py
   python harmonia_ratio_verification.py
   python celtic_vs_kepler_comparison.py
   python celtic_mape_optimization.py
   python harmonia_orbit_node_2_14.py
   python harmonic_ladder_RMSE_HSI_Residuals_symlog_final.py
   python planetary_harmonic_percent_deviation_with_inset.py
   ```
   Each script will automatically produce .pdf and .png outputs in the working directory.

## 🧭 Verification Notes
For details on digital signatures and cryptographic timestamps, see the *Authorship and Integrity* section above.  
All original research files were timestamped and signed for integrity using:

- **.asc** → GPG digital signature  
- **.ots** → OpenTimestamps blockchain proof  
- **_proof.txt** → SHA-256 manifest  

Verification materials are stored in the private `/proof/` archive and are available for independent validation upon request.
