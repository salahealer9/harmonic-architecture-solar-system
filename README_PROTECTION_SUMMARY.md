# üîí Discovery Protection Summary

## Overview
This repository and its associated research are protected by verifiable cryptographic evidence of authorship and integrity.  
All key research files have been **digitally signed** and **timestamped** using open, decentralized systems to ensure their authenticity and originality.

The full verification set ‚Äî including `.asc` (GPG signatures), `.ots` (OpenTimestamps proofs), and `_proof.txt` (SHA-256 manifests) ‚Äî is securely archived in a private `/proof/` folder.

## üßæ Protection Methodology

| Layer | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| **GPG Signature (.asc)** | Confirms authorship identity using a cryptographic public/private keypair. |
| **SHA-256 Manifest (_proof.txt)** | Contains cryptographic checksums and timestamp metadata for each protected file. |
| **OpenTimestamps (.ots)** | Anchors each checksum into the Bitcoin blockchain, providing an immutable, verifiable proof of creation date. |

These methods collectively guarantee:
- Proof of authorship and date of discovery  
- File integrity and reproducibility  
- Resistance to tampering or unauthorized modification
